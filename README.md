**Project Objective:** The overall goal is for students to practice using NumPy data structures to create basic linear regression models and other matrix operations. Students will understand the basic data structures of NumPy, including arrays and matrices, and some matrix operations. Students will also practice updating an existing array, which is a very valuable skill in coursework and industry. Then students will verify basic linear algebra results with matrix operations in NumPy. Finally, students explore polynomial featurization, which essentially applies many earlier NumPy skills.

**Navigating the Repository:** There are several important files in the repository. You should first review the slides "OPECSlides.pdf" and the notes "OPEC_Notes.pdf" to ensure you have a basic conceptual understanding of the topics to be covered in the main notebook. Don't worry if you are not comfortable with everything; the notebook will certainly help with that. Next, complete the Jupyter Notebook titled "OPECNotebook.ipynb". Once you have completed all code cells to the best of your ability, your next task is to finish the quiz titled "OPEC_quiz.ipynb".
